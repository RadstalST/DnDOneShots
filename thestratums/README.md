# Start of the Adventure
## The Guild
As the players approach the modest wooden building, they see a simple sign hanging above the entrance that reads "Adventurer's Guild". A bustling crowd of adventurers, both old and new, are milling about outside, some discussing their latest exploits while others are trying to find a new party to join.

As the players enter the building, they find themselves in a cramped, noisy foyer filled with adventurers from all walks of life. The receptionist, a grizzled old adventurer with a friendly smile, greets them and explains that the Adventurer's Guild has recently expanded to this new land, and is actively seeking new members to explore the uncharted wilderness.


## The Receptionist

    The half-orc woman standing behind the reception desk is tall and muscular, with broad shoulders and a no-nonsense demeanor. Her skin is a deep shade of green, and her short, tousled hair is a vibrant red that contrasts sharply with her tusks. She wears a simple but sturdy leather tunic and trousers, and a pair of rugged boots that have seen their fair share of wear and tear. Despite her gruff appearance, there is a hint of warmth in her amber eyes as she greets the newcomers to the guild.

*insert the portrait here*

Well well well, look what the cat dragged in! New recruits, eh? You're just in time. We just discovered a new dungeon nearby, and let me tell you, it's not for the faint of heart.
>
>But hey, you look like you've got some fight in you. If you're up for a challenge, we can set you up with a mentor to show you the ropes. Just be warned, this dungeon is no walk in the park. It's filled with all sorts of nasty creatures and traps, and you'll need to be tough as nails to make it through.
>
>But for those who can hack it, the rewards can be sweet. You can make a name for yourself, get rich, or even uncover some long-lost treasure. The sky's the limit!
>
>So, what do you say? You ready to put your money where your mouth is and join the Adventurer's Guild? If so, get your contracts here, and let's get you started on the adventure of a lifetime!"


The players quickly learn that a new dungeon has been discovered just a few days ago, and the guild is sending out teams to explore its depths. As new recruits, they are assigned a veteran adventurer as their mentor, who will guide them through their training and help them navigate the dangerous wilderness.

## Contracts

>As the players approach the receptionist, she hands them a contract and a pen. "Just sign here, and you're all set. We'll get you started on your first adventure right away. Good luck out there, and don't die!"



The contract is a simple piece of parchment with a few lines of text written on it. The players are instructed to sign their name at the bottom, and then hand the contract back to the receptionist. The text reads:

    Contract of Adventurer
    In exchange for a small fee, the Adventurer's Guild will provide the following services to the undersigned:
    - A mentor to guide the recruit through their training
    - A small stipend to cover the cost of food and lodging
    - A small bonus for each successful mission
    
    The undersigned agrees to the following terms:
    - To complete all training missions assigned by the guild
    - ...

## The Mentor

The mentor is there as an NPC that guide them to the dungeon, answering most of the questions they have. They can also be used to introduce the players to the setting, and give them a few hints about the dungeon. The mentor is also there to help the players if they get stuck, and to give them a few hints if they get stuck.

    a veteran explorer named Grimgar, who has been with the guild for many years and knows the dungeon inside and out. He's a gruff, no-nonsense dwarf with a thick beard and a no-nonsense attitude. 

- "Listen up, new recruits. If you want to make it out of this dungeon alive, you're going to have to listen to me and do exactly as I say. Got it?"
- "You think this is some kind of game? This dungeon will chew you up and spit you out if you're not careful. Stick with me and I'll show you how to survive."
- "I've been in this dungeon more times than I can count, and let me tell you, it never gets any easier. But with the right attitude and a bit of luck, we might just make it out in one piece."
- "Don't get too comfortable, newbies. This dungeon has a way of humbling even the most experienced adventurers. Stay sharp, stay focused, and we might just make it through."


# The Strata

The first stratum of the dungeon is a vast network of tunnels and caverns, illuminated by the soft glow of bioluminescent mushrooms. The ground is covered in a thick layer of moist soil and fungus, and the air is thick with the scent of decay and growth. As the adventurers make their way through the winding passages, they can hear the distant sound of rushing water and feel the gentle vibrations of the earth beneath their feet.

    the dungeon was formed as a result of the impact of a meteorite that crashed into the area centuries ago. The meteorite contained a rare, magical mineral that had the ability to transform the surrounding landscape, creating the intricate tunnels and caverns that make up the dungeon.

    Over time, the mineral's power diminished, but the effects of its presence remain, resulting in the unique ecosystem of the dungeon, with glowing mushrooms, dangerous creatures, and shifting tunnels that could collapse at any moment. The dungeon has become a coveted destination for adventurers seeking to test their skills and uncover the secrets of the ancient mineral that created it.

As the adventurers delve deeper into the dungeon, they may come across ancient ruins and artifacts left behind by previous explorers. They may also encounter strange, fungal creatures and otherworldly beings that have made the dungeon their home. But they must be careful, for the earth itself seems to have a will of its own, and one wrong step could trigger a collapse that could bury them alive in the dark, twisting tunnels.


## Entrance
The entrance could be hidden or obscured in some way. Perhaps there is a cave system that leads to the stratum, and the adventurers have to navigate a maze of twisting passages and tunnels to find it. Alternatively, the entrance could be a small crack in the ground or a hole in a cliff face that is easy to miss.

## The MAP

*insert dungeon map here*
**or even better** make a map generator...
>the Author is a bit lazy and doesn't want to make a map generator...
>but He would like to make a map generator...


## Ecology

In the stratum, the ants and the moth would have a mutually beneficial relationship. The ants would help maintain the structure of the tunnels by burrowing and removing debris, while also serving as a food source for the moth.

In turn, the moth would use its time-manipulation abilities to slow down the ants' natural activities, preventing them from overburdening the structure and causing it to collapse.

However, when the players entered the stratum and disrupted the natural order, the ants may have become more aggressive and overzealous, causing the tunnel collapse that led to the first encounter. The moth may have sensed the disturbance and attacked the players to protect the stratum, not realizing that the players were not intentionally causing harm.

## Time-Dilation Aura

As a legendary action, the Moth can activate its Time-Dilation Aura, which creates a 30-foot radius aura centered on itself. The aura lasts for 1 minute and affects all creatures within its radius, including the Moth's allies. While within the aura, time seems to slow down or speed up depending on the Moth's whim.

At the start of each creature's turn within the aura, the Moth rolls a d4. If the result is odd, time slows down, and all affected creatures have disadvantage on their attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until the start of their next turn. If the result is even, time speeds up, and all affected creatures have advantage on their attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until the start of their next turn.

## Time-Dilation Ability

Once per day, the Moth can use its Time-Dilation ability, which targets one creature within 60 feet of it. The targeted creature must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature's time perception becomes distorted, and they are affected by the Time-Dilation Aura for 1 minute. If the creature succeeds, they are immune to the Moth's Time-Dilation Aura for the next 24 hours.

## Actions

### Multi-Attack

The moth makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.

### Claws

Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.

### Bite

Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage.

### Reactive Camouflage 

(1/day). When the moth takes damage, it can use its reaction to blend in with its surroundings, gaining advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks until the end of its next turn.

### Wing Attack

The giant moth beats its wings, creating a gust of wind that affects all creatures within a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away from the moth and knocked prone.

### Chrono-Nullifying Fern

    The plant that negates the time-dilation effect is called the Chrono-Nullifying Fern. It is a common plant that grows abundantly in the first stratum of the dungeon, especially in areas with strong time-dilation effects. The fern has broad, green leaves that are slightly fuzzy to the touch. When the leaves are crushed or boiled, they release a potent aroma that can neutralize the effects of the Time-Dilation Aura.

Adventurers who venture into the dungeon are advised (from the DM) to gather as much Chrono-Nullifying Fern as they can to protect themselves from the time-dilation effects. However, the fern is highly sought after by other creatures that inhabit the dungeon, and adventurers may need to fight off these creatures to obtain the fern.

## Shifting Tectonic plates
The shifting of the tectonic plates has caused the first stratum of the dungeon to become unstable, with sections of the tunnels and caverns collapsing in on themselves. However, the presence of the Moths has helped to prevent the entire stratum from collapsing, as they use their time-dilation abilities to slow the rate of decay and decay of the surrounding earth.

Meanwhile, the Ants have been busy carving out new tunnels and passages, expanding the labyrinthine network of the dungeon even further. Their constant activity keeps the earth constantly shifting and changing, making it difficult for adventurers to navigate and survive.

But amidst all this chaos, a small plant has managed to thrive in the midst of the damp soil and fungus. The Fern's presence seems to have a calming effect on the surrounding area, somehow stabilizing the Moth's time-dilation aura and preventing it from becoming too chaotic.

As adventurers venture deeper into the dungeon, they will have to navigate through these various elements, avoiding the collapsing tunnels, battling the ants, and seeking out the Fern to help them neutralize the Moth's time-dilation effect.


# Conclusion
In conclusion, the first stratum of the dungeon is a dangerous and unstable network of tunnels and caverns, formed by the impact of a rare, magical mineral. The earth beneath is constantly shifting and the tunnels are at risk of collapsing at any moment, but the presence of the moth and ants have prevented it from collapsing entirely. However, their presence also makes it difficult for adventurers to navigate and survive within the dungeon.

The moth's time-dilation aura slows and quickens time in a pattern, making it difficult for adventurers to act consistently. The ants create new tunnels and are aggressive defenders of their home, making escape even more difficult. However, the presence of the fern, which can be found in abundance, negates the effects of the time-dilation aura, providing a glimmer of hope for adventurers seeking to explore the dungeon.

Overall, the first stratum of the dungeon offers a unique and challenging experience for adventurers, with the potential for great rewards for those brave enough to navigate its dangers.
